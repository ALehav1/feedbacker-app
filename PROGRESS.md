## 🎯 Current State

**Status:** Authentication system complete, ready for database setup

**What's Working:**
- ✅ Project builds successfully
- ✅ TypeScript types properly defined
- ✅ Auth components created and integrated
- ✅ Routing structure in place

**What Needs Your Action:**
- ⚠️ Supabase database setup (follow steps above)
- ⚠️ Environment variables configuration
- ⚠️ Test magic link authentication

**What's Next After Database Setup:**
- Build profile setup page
- Create dashboard with session list
- Implement session creation wizard

---

## 🔍 Architecture Notes

### Authentication Flow
```
1. User enters email on LoginPage
2. Supabase sends magic link email
3. User clicks link → /auth/callback
4. AuthCallback checks if presenter exists
   - If yes → redirect to /dashboard
   - If no → redirect to /dashboard/profile (first-time setup)
5. AuthContext maintains session via onAuthStateChange
```

### Session State Machine
```
draft → active → completed → archived
```

### Database Tables
- `presenters` - User profiles
- `sessions` - Presentation sessions
- `themes` - AI-generated themes
- `responses` - Participant feedback
- `theme_selections` - Interest signals (more/less)

## 🐛 Known Issues

**Markdown Linting (Non-Critical):**
- `supabase/README.md` has formatting warnings
- These are cosmetic and don't affect functionality
- Can be fixed later if needed

**No Critical Issues:** Build passes, TypeScript clean

---

## 📝 Testing Checklist (After Database Setup)

- [ ] Magic link email received
- [ ] Click link redirects to /auth/callback
- [ ] New user redirects to /dashboard/profile
- [ ] Returning user redirects to /dashboard
- [ ] Protected routes block unauthenticated access
- [ ] Sign out works correctly
- [ ] No console errors

---

## 💡 Tips

1. **Check Supabase Logs:** If magic link doesn't work, check Supabase logs for errors
2. **Email Spam Folder:** Magic links sometimes go to spam
3. **Browser Console:** Keep it open to catch any errors
4. **Database Verification:** Use Supabase Table Editor to verify data

**Ready to proceed once you've set up the database!**
